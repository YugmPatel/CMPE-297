# 🧠 Google ADK Agent Applications — End-to-End Implementations

This repository contains five complete end-to-end (E2E) **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** projects built following official Google Cloud Codelabs and community examples.
Each project demonstrates how to design, build, and deploy intelligent agents using ADK, Gemini models, MCP tools, and Google Cloud Run.

## 📋 Project Overview

| No. | Agent Name                          | Description                                                                                                                | Reference                                   |
| --- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| a)  | Deep Research Lead Generation Agent | Automates lead generation by performing in-depth research, ranking, and data enrichment using ADK pipelines.               | Google Cloud Blog, GitHub Sample Repository |
| b)  | Advanced Tool Agent (Gemini CLI)    | Demonstrates integration of the Gemini CLI as a tool within an ADK pipeline for enhanced reasoning and execution.          | Medium Article, GitHub Repository           |
| c)  | MCP Tools Bug Assistance Agent      | Builds a bug resolution and debugging assistant using MCP tool integration within ADK.                                     | Google Cloud Blog, ADK Samples              |
| d)  | Code Review Assistant               | A production-ready code reviewer that analyzes and provides improvement suggestions using ADK and Gemini models.           | Google Codelab, GitHub Repository           |
| e)  | E-Commerce Agent with ADK           | A complete e-commerce assistant that connects ADK, MCP, and AlloyDB for handling product recommendations and user queries. | Google Codelab, GitHub Repository           |

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1. Clone this repository and open it locally.
2. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies listed in each agent folder.
3. Each project directory includes its own setup guide and configuration files.
4. Follow the respective Codelab or documentation for pipeline initialization and ADK configuration.

---

## 🧩 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into five main directories, each corresponding to one ADK agent project.
Each folder contains implementation files, configuration files, screenshots, and a README describing setup and execution steps.
Additionally, there is a **video_walkthrough** folder containing demonstration videos for all agents.

---

## 🧠 Walkthrough & Deliverables

Each project includes the following artifacts:

* A detailed explanation of architecture and workflow.
* Source code with pipeline configuration (YAML/JSON).
* Screenshots of important outputs and logs.
* A short video demonstrating code walkthrough and execution process.

All five agents were developed, tested, and executed using the ADK environment and verified with sample data.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

* Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
* Vertex AI and Gemini Models
* Google Cloud Run
* MCP Tools
* AlloyDB
* Gemini CLI
* Python 3.10+
* Streamlit (for visualization)

---

## 🧪 Execution Process

1. Initialize ADK and configure environment variables.
2. Run the agent pipeline locally or deploy to Google Cloud Run.
3. Monitor logs, responses, and tool integrations via ADK dashboard.
4. Capture execution video and summarize findings in the report.

---

## 🎥 Video Demonstration

Each agent includes a short video that explains:

* Objective and purpose of the agent.
* Code structure and major functions.
* Step-by-step execution process.
* Output and results demonstration.

All videos are available in the **video_walkthrough** folder and linked in each subproject’s README.
