# ðŸ¤– Codelab 1 â€“ Create Multi-Agent System with ADK and A2A Protocol

ðŸ“– **Reference:** [Google Codelab â€“ Create Multi-Agents with ADK & A2A](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/create-multi-agents-adk-a2a#0)

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This codelab demonstrates how to create and deploy a **multi-agent system** using Googleâ€™s **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** protocol.
The goal is to build multiple agents, deploy them to the **Agent Engine**, and establish communication between them using **A2A messaging**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Install and configure the **ADK** environment.
* Create and deploy multiple agents to the **Agent Engine**.
* Enable **A2A communication** between agents.
* Demonstrate message exchange using the **A2A protocol**.

---

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.10+
* Node.js (optional, for web UI integration)
* Google **Agent Engine** account
* Installed **ADK CLI** and **A2A SDK**
* Stable internet connection

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

* **ADK (Agent Development Kit):** Toolset for creating and managing agents.
* **Agent Engine:** Cloud environment where agents are deployed and executed.
* **A2A Protocol:** Enables secure, structured message exchange between agents.
* **MCP (Message Communication Protocol):** Defines message structure and routing behavior.

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Walkthrough

ðŸŽ¬ **YouTube Walkthrough:** [Click here to watch the demo](https://youtu.be/oYPckTgBT0w)

The walkthrough demonstrates:

1. ADK environment setup
2. Agent creation and configuration
3. Deployment in the Agent Engine
4. A2A message exchange between agents

---

## ðŸ§© Learnings

* Setting up a complete ADK-based environment
* Understanding the internal flow of the A2A protocol
* Deploying, managing, and debugging multi-agent systems
* Building a foundation for advanced agent collaboration projects

Would you like me to now prepare the **Codelab 2 README (Currency Agent)** next â€” following the same style with a YouTube walkthrough section at the end?
