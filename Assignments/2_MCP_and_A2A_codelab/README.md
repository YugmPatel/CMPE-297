# Multi-Agent System using ADK, MCP, and A2A Protocols

## üìò Overview

This project is part of the assignment to practice **MCP (Message Communication Protocol)** and **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** protocols using **Google‚Äôs Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.
The assignment reproduces and demonstrates three official Google Codelabs on building and deploying multi-agent systems.

Each codelab is implemented separately, and all related artifacts (code, configurations, assets, and documentation) are included in their respective directories.

```

Each subdirectory includes:

* Source code and configuration files
* Build and deployment instructions
* Video walkthrough demonstrating execution

**Objective:**

* Build a basic multi-agent system using ADK.
* Deploy agents on the Agent Engine.
* Enable agent-to-agent communication using A2A protocol.

---

### **Codelab 2 ‚Äì Getting Started with ADK, MCP, and A2A**

**Objective:**

* Learn the basics of ADK setup.
* Use MCP for message communication between agents.
* Integrate A2A to simulate interaction between a currency converter agent and a user agent.

---

### **Codelab 3 ‚Äì Getting Started with A2A Action Engine**

**Objective:**

* Understand the A2A Action Engine architecture.
* Implement and test an agent that performs purchase-related actions via A2A.
* Demonstrate inter-agent actions and data exchange.
