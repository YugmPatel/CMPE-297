# MCP and A2A Codelab Assignment

## üìò Overview

This repository contains the implementation and artifacts for three Google codelabs focusing on **ADK (Agent Development Kit)**, **MCP (Message Communication Protocol)**, and **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** communication.
The goal is to practice creating, deploying, and interacting with multi-agent systems using the Google Agent Engine and A2A protocol.

## üìÑ Deliverables

| Deliverable       | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub Repository | Source code and artifacts for all 3 codelabs        |
| Video Walkthrough | Demonstration of execution for each codelab         |
| Subdirectories    | Organized structure for each lab with documentation |

---

Would you like me to also create **individual `README.md` templates** for each subdirectory (Codelab 1, 2, and 3) ‚Äî summarizing the specific setup and results for each?
That would make your submission look more professional and complete.
